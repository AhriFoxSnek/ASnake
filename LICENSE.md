TEMPORARY DO NOT DO ANYTHING UNTIL I HAVE DECIDED ON A LICENSE, LICENSE. 

* I have not decided on a license yet, so until I have done so, the following applies:
  * DO NOT copy the software.
  * DO NOT run the software.
  * DO NOT accidentally or intentionally memorize the software.
  * DO NOT create a business based around this software.
  * DO NOT redefine the word software to mean something other than source code resembling the files in this repository.
  * DO NOT modify the software, or mutate it using genetic programming.
  * DO NOT feed this software into a machine learning algorithm.
  * DO NOT criticize or praise the quality of the source code.
  * DO NOT contribute to the software's repository.
  * DO NOT attempt to convert the software to another file format in order to get around resembling the files in this repository.
  * DO NOT fork or spoon this repository.

Unless you are a friend of mine, then the above does not apply. 
I am not a lawyer, just want to be safe until I decide on a license. 
The above will no longer apply as soon as I decide on a new license, then you must follow that new license. 
Ok, bye bye!
